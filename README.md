# myvyos-demo
This is a demo site for a potential integration between VyOS installs and a centralized repository

A copy of this is currently running at https://myvyos.kroy.io/. Create an account there and generate an API key.  

This API key goes in `collector.py`, which needs to be run on the VyOS system.  Ideally this script would eventually have tighter integration into the various VyOS apis.
